<h1>Sodoku Solver.</h1>
<p> This is a program that solves the famous game Sodoku. The idea is that in the matrix all the numbers represented by -1 are == to 0, and the positive numbers are the numbers that need to be changed by the numbers in the real Sodoku that is going to be solved and at the end the solution is printed. in case the solution is possible, a True message will be printed, if tgere is no possibility to solve the Sodoku, a False message will be printed. If all the numbers are correctly in the matrix, there will be certainly a solution.
